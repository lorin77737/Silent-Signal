# 🚨 Silent Signal - Smart Monitoring & Warning System

**Silent Signal** is an ESP32-based environmental monitoring system that tracks temperature, humidity, and structural vibration. It uses a tiered alert system to notify users through physical hardware (LEDs and Buzzers) and mobile notifications via the **Blynk IoT platform**.

## 🛠 Features

* **Real-time Monitoring:** Tracks Temperature and Humidity via DHT11.
* **Vibration Detection:** Detects physical interference or structural instability.
* **Tiered Alert System:**
* **🟢 SAFE:** Solid Green LED.
* **🟡 WARNING:** Blinking Green LED + Pulsing Buzzer (Temp > 30°C).
* **🟠 CRITICAL:** Blinking Orange LED + Steady Siren + Phone Alert (Temp < 17°C, > 45°C, or Vibration).


* **Cloud Integration:** Full dashboard control and mobile notifications using Blynk.

## ⚙️ Logic Thresholds

| Condition | Hardware Response | Mobile Alert |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Temp > 45°C** | 🟠 Blinking Orange + Buzzer | "Overheating (>45°C)" |
| **Temp < 17°C** | 🟠 Blinking Orange + Buzzer | "Freezing Temp (<17°C)" |
| **Vibration** | 🟠 Orange + 🟡 Yellow + Buzzer | "Heavy Vibration Detected" |
| **Temp > 30°C** | 🟢 Blinking Green + Buzzer | "High Temp Warning (>30°C)" |
| **Humidity > 80%** | 🔵 Blue LED ON | N/A |

## 🚀 Setup Instructions

### 1. Blynk Dashboard Setup

1. Create a new Template in Blynk named **"Silent Signal"**.
2. Add the following **Datastreams**:
* **V0 (Virtual Pin):** Temperature (Double)
* **V1 (Virtual Pin):** Humidity (Double)
* **V2 (Virtual Pin):** Vibration (Integer)


3. Create an **Event** called `critical_alert` under the "Events & Notifications" tab. Set it to "Push Notification."

### 2. Software Configuration

1. Install the following libraries in your Arduino IDE:
* `Blynk`
* `DHT sensor library`
* `Adafruit Unified Sensor`


2. Update the `BLYNK_AUTH_TOKEN`, `ssid`, and `pass` variables in the code with your credentials.

### 3. Deployment

1. Connect your ESP32 to your computer.
2. Select the correct COM port and board (DOIT ESP32 DEVKIT V1).
3. Upload the code and open the Serial Monitor at **115200 baud** to verify the connection.
